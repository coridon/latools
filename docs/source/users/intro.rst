Laser Ablation Tools (`latools`) is a python toolbox for processing Laser Ablations Mass Spectrometry (LA-MS) data.

Why Use latools?
----------------

At present, most LA-MS data is processed (at least partly) by hand.
This introduces subjectivity in data analysis, and tests have shown that independent expert analysts can obtain significantly different results from the same raw data.
At present, there is no standard way of reporting LA-MS data analysis, which would allow an independent user to obtain the same results from the same raw data.
''latools'' is designed to tackle this problem.

''latools'' brings two significant advances in LA-MS data processing:

1. It allows the systematic, objectibe processing of LA-MS data, by defining a series of processing parameters. These parameters can be exported and published alongside LA-MS studies, and used by an independent ''latools'' user to exactly reproduce the full data analysis.
2. It can dramatically speed up data processing, allowing the processing of hundreds of analyses in a matter of minutes.

To start using `latools`, begin by :ref:`install` latools on your system, then follow the :ref:`getting_started` guide.
