*In development.*

All scripts written by a working scientist, not a coder, and are provided 'as is'. That said, if you are having issues with them, or would like to see additional features, please get in touch or join as a contributor.


## Project Structure
- data and analysis objects are in 'objects.py' at the top level.
- 'resources' contains SRM values for NIST610, 612 and 614 from GEOREM. If you wish to use other standards, you must add them.
- 'test data' contains some example laser data, used for development.
