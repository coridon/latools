Before you install latools, you'll need to make sure you have a working installation of python, preferably version 3.5+. If you're unsure about this, we've got some basic instructions on how to set thip up in our :ref:`getting_started` section.

All the code for ``latools`` is open source, and hosted on `Github <https://github.com/>`_. This means that you can look at, and contribute to (if you're so inclined) the software by visiting its `Github page <https://github.com/oscarbranson/latools>`_.

The simplest (and recommended) way to install the latest version of ``latools`` is directly from the the github repository using the ``pip`` package manager:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type (or copy & paste):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/oscarbranson/latools.git@master

3. Wait a moment...

This will download and install the latest version of ``latools`` from Github. In the future if you'd like to update ``latools`` to the latest version it's as adding ``--upgrade`` to the end of the code above.

If this is your first time, read through the :ref:`getting_started` guide. Otherwise, you're good to go!
